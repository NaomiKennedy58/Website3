    <li>The Silmarillion</li>

    <li>The Fellowship of the Ring</li>
    <li>The Two Towers</li>
    <li>Return of the King</li>
</ol>

<h3>The Valar</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Melkor/Morgoth, the most powerful. Arguably represents Eru's own dark side.
        <p>Craved the Flame Imperishable, and marred Arda.</p></li>
    <li>Manwe, King of the Valar, creator of the winds. Sends the Eagles as his messengers.</li>
    <li><p>Varda, Queen of the Valar. Right from the Music of the Ainur, she saw Melkor's malicious plans.</p>
        <p>She helped to create the Two Lamps and the Two Trees, and she hallowed the Silmarils.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>It is up for debate, whether or not the Valar abandoned Middle Earth, locking themselves up in the ivory towers of Valinor. <br>
    Beginning with the First War, Melkor poured his evil and his will to dominate into Arda itself, meaning that killing him would have meant destroying the world they had helped to create.</p>
